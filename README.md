there are multiple fields to enter for each customer, things like name, phone model, service charge etc

There is also a search function that is used to verify if a customer had a previous transaction with the store, if not then the application will know and can identify the customer
hasn't madea previous transaction.

currentlty a prototype addtional features incoming.
